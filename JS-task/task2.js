// Task 2 - Queue at the supermarket
// There is a certain queue in a supermarket with the possibility of self-service.
// Task: write a function that calculates the total time required to serve all people.
// The function takes two arguments:
// 1- Customers, an array of positive numbers representing the number of people in line. Every number indicates the amount of time required to serve one customer.
// 	2-The number of cash registers, a positive number.

// The function should return a number, how much time is required in total.
// There is only one queue.
// The queue order never changes.
// We assume that the first person approaches the cash register as soon as it is freed.

// Explanation:
// queueTime([5,3,4], 1)
// 3 customers that require 5, 3 and 4 minutes respectively and 1 checkout
// Output: 12 (5 + 3 + 4)

// queueTime([10, 2, 3, 3], 2)
// 4 customers that require 10, 2, 3 and 3 minutes respectively and 2 checkout
// Output: 10

// queueTime([], 1); - no customers, 1 каса
// Output: 0

// Tests:
// queueTime([ 26, 42, 13, 18, 48, 38, 39, 25, 39, 6, 35, 11, 7, 38, 19, 14 ], 1) // 418

// queueTime([ 34, 31, 40, 30, 48, 2, 19, 32, 37, 13, 30, 49, 3, 13, 12, 43, 39, 22, 47 ], 4) // 162

// queueTime([ 19, 1, 27, 35, 16, 4, 45, 49, 41, 25 ], 5) // 65

const customers = [
  // 1, 2, 3, 4
  // 10, 2, 3, 3
  // 26, 42, 13, 18, 48, 38, 39, 25, 39, 6, 35, 11, 7, 38, 19, 14
  // 34, 31, 40, 30, 48, 2, 19, 32, 37, 13, 30, 49, 3, 13, 12, 43, 39, 22, 47
  19, 1, 27, 35, 16, 4, 45, 49, 41, 25
]
const count = 5;

function queueTime(customers, countTerminals) {
  const terminals = Array(countTerminals).fill(0);

  for (let i = 0; i < customers.length; i++) {
    const minTerminals = Math.min(...terminals);
    const index = terminals.findIndex(el => el === minTerminals); 
    
    terminals[index] += customers[i];
    console.log(index, terminals);
  }


  return Math.max(...terminals);

console.log('queueTime', queueTime(customers, count));
